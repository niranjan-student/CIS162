            <p>Hi everyone, my name is Niranjan Janardhanan. 
                I love everything technology, especially software, so I'm learning as many coding languages as I can.
                I currently know python and am learning html and java.
                By the end of summer, I want to have learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript so i can make a website on my own. 
                A fun fact about me is that I lived in New Zealand for a year.
                I am also learning japanese and enjoy watching anime.
            </p>
